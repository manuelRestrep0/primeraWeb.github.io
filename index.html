    <b><p leng="en">It starts with one thing
      I don't know why
      It doesn't even matter how hard you try
      Keep that in mind
      I designed this rhyme
      To explain in due time
      All I know time is a valuable thing
      Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
      Watch it count down to the end of the day
      The clock ticks life away
      It's so unreal
      Didn't look out below
      Watch the time go right out the window
      Trying to hold on
      But didn't even know
      Wasted it all just to watch you go
      I kept everything inside and even though I tried
      It all fell apart
      What it meant to me
      Will eventually be a memory of a time when...
      
      I tried so hard
      And got so far
      But in the end
      It doesn't even matter
      I had to fall
      to lose it all
      But in the end
      It doesn't even matter
      
      One thing
      I don't know why
      it doesnâ€™t even matter how hard you try
      Keep that in mind
      I designed this rhyme
      To remind myself how
      I tried so hard
      In spite of the way you were mocking me
      I acted like I was part of your property
      Remembering all the times you fought with me
      I'm surprised
      It got so far
      Things aren't the way they were before
      You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
      Not that you knew me back then
      But it all comes back to me
      In the end
      I kept everything inside and even though I tried
      It all fell apart
      What it meant to me
      Will eventually be a memory of a time when I
      
      I tried so hard
      And got so far
      But in the end
      It doesn't even matter
      I had to fall
      to lose it all
      But in the end
      It doesn't even matter
      
      I put my trust in you
      Pushed as far as I can go
      And for all this
      There's only one thing you should know
      I put my trust in you
      Pushed as far as I can go
      And for all this
      There's only one thing you should know
      
      I tried so hard
      And got so far
      But in the end
      It doesn't even matter
      I had to fall
      to lose it all
      But in the end
      It doesn't even matter</p></b>
